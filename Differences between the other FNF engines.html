<h1>Differences between the other FNF engines.</h1>
<h4>First of all, <strong>this engine does not have built-in LUA scripting,</strong> like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine&quot;&gt;Psych Engine&lt;/a&gt;.</h4>
<p>Codename engine is based on <strong>Base Game's week 6 code</strong> (AKA. version 0.2.7.1), and shows heavy modifications from the original source (for example, optimized PlayState ~1400 lines, rewritten systems etc.). It is not a fork of any other engines and hasn't taken code from other engines either.</p>
<p>Compared to the usual engines (Psych Engine, FPS plus), these are the few differences that makes it stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripting system is specifically HScript Improved, a custom fork made by the devs themselves.</li>
<li>Uses forks of popular libraries tailored specifically for the engine for the goal of better optimization.</li>
<li>Modding system and softcoding is as capable as source coding.</li>
<li>Focuses heavily on optimization, and encourages its users to also take on optimization practices.</li>
<li>Bloated, in the sense that it offers as many modding tools as possible without changing the core gameplay and the base to mod on.</li>
<li>Allows modularity using addons and mods that apply on top of the core mod.</li>
<li>Advanced editors which allows for possibly better experience and easiness when creating the mod.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Please keep in mind that, despite these differences, we do not consider our engine to be any better than the others and this page exists purely for people to distinguish our engine from the other engines in the community.</h6>
