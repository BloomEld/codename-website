welcome to the world of indiscretions, an experimental fnf mod that will tell a story as time goes on. you play as a character named, "precursor", a character who lost all memory, all she can find was a notebook that contained her thoughts and feelings in them, and a vhs player with a tape that will hopefully give her answers of who she once was.
