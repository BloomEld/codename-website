# Deprecations

As much as we want to keep backwards compatibility, we just can't, the code has become messy, and annoying to work with. So we are gonna deprecate stuff. But we are gonna keep it in the engine a bit longer so you guys can update your mods, but after the countdown, it will be removed.

**Notice:** Not everything will be removed, but just the messy stuff, that we think is not worth the time to fix, nor isn't used by a lot.

## <h2 id="old-opponent-coop-system">Old Opponent/Coop system</h2>

<div>
    <countdown-timer data-date="awaiting-date" />
</div>

This was the old system for opponent mode and coop mode, but we are replacing it with a new system called Scripted Game Modes.
