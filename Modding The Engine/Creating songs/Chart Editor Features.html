<h1>Additional Chart Editor Features</h1>
<p>while we have only covered the basic of charting in &lt;a href=&quot;./index.md&quot;&gt;Creating songs&lt;/a&gt;, we will cover the additional chart editor features here, in no particular order.</p>
<h2>Strumlines.</h2>
<h3>More than 2.</h3>
<p>Songs in Codename Engine are more modular, in the sense that you're no longer restricted to just 2 strumlines. This means that, you can have as many strumlines and characters in the song as you like. Moreover, Girlfriend also gets her own strumline.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3>Moving around.</h3>
<p>This is only an in-editor thing, but if you don't like how the Strumlines are ordered, and prefer a different order, you can reposition them easily with just this lock button.&lt;br&gt;
(insert a gif here)</p>
<h3>Hitsounds</h3>
<p>Pretty self explanatory, but you get to choose which Strumline should play a Hitsound when you get past a Note.</p>

<h3>Waveforms.</h3>
<p>Waveforms allows for visualizing songs, and we have that too. You get 2 or more options depending on how many audio files you have in the songs.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-2.png&quot;/&gt;</p>

<h3>Editing Strumlines Data.</h3>
<p>Strumlines have more options than usual, being able to do things without scripting them in.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-4.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Characters</strong>, is where you input your characters. As you can see, you can have more than one character per Strumline.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>, is where you determine the type of the strumline. Player makes the Strumline playable by a player, while Opponent and Additional makes the Strumline be handled by a CPU.</li>
<li><strong>Stage positioning</strong>, is where you select where the Strumline characters will be placed, pretty self-explanatory.</li>
<li><strong>Scale and HUD position</strong>, is where you set the scale of the strumline and the position in the HUD. <em>(keep in mind when setting the HUD positioning, the X axis is determined by a float, aka. 0.25 is Opponent side, 0.75 is Player side, and 0.5 is the middle point, while y axis uses actual positioning)</em></li>
<li><strong>Visible</strong> determines whether or not your Strumline shows up in the song. If you have it disabled, your Strumline will cease to exist <em>(though your notes will be intact and still play)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Scroll Speed and that switch with a long name in it</strong> determines if this Strumline should use a scroll speed, separately from the other Strumlines.</li>
<li><strong>Vocal Suffix</strong> is covered in this next section.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multi-Vocals</h3>
<p>You can have different vocal audio files per Strumline. As seen previously, there's an option to set Vocal Suffixes on a Strumline.</p>
<p>For this, you have to obviously have different vocal audio files ready, with a suffix at the end <em>(for example <code>Voices-bf.ogg</code> has a <code>-bf</code> suffix at the end)</em>

&lt;img src=&quot;./Chart Editor Features-15.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h2>Events &amp; Notetypes.</h2>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Events exist in the Chart Editor to avoid coding a lot of code for just a few events. Some of them are already built-in but you can also code your own <em>(see &lt;a href=&quot;../Scripting/PlayState Scripts/Events or Notetype Scripts.md&quot;&gt;Events/Notetype Scripts&lt;/a&gt;)</em>.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-5.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-6.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Each event has it's own parameters, instead of a pre-established number of parameters. &lt;br&gt; Events are also stackable, without having to painstakingly putting them close together.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-8.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-7.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Events are also movable.&lt;br&gt;
(insert gif of moving events)</p>
<h3>Notetypes</h3>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-9.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>You can code your own notetypes, or use the pre-existing one <em>(though only 2 exists currently)</em>. They need to first be added to the Notetypes list before being able to use them. Afterwards you can simply select them from the dropdown here.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-10.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>You can also change the graphic of a Notetype without programming, by putting the Notetype's spritesheet in <code>images/game/notes</code>.</p>
<h2>Changing additional chart/meta data.</h2>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-12.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>If you wish to change some data regarding the chart <em>(scroll speed, bpm, stage etc.)</em>, you can do so here.</p>
<h3>Editing chart data.</h3>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-13.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Editing chart data has only 2 options, and they're self explanatory.</p>
<h3>Editing metadata information.</h3>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-14.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>Editing metadata information, is also self-explanatory, though you can notice this menu is similar to what you've seen in &lt;a href=&quot;./index.md&quot;&gt;Creating songs&lt;/a&gt;, so this should be easy to figure out. Though you might also notice there's a new option, <strong>Custom Values</strong>. These are extra values that let's you set certain values specifically for the song <em>(for example, crediting someone for a song)</em>. This will be covered in &lt;a href=&quot;../Scripting/PlayState Scripts/Gameplay Scripts.md&quot;&gt;Gameplay Scripts&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<h2>Saving.</h2>
<p>The chart editor allows for multiple ways to save a chart. Currently, there's about 10 ways to save the information of a chart.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=&quot;Chart Editor Features-11.png&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>We know what the first option does, but what about those other ones? Well, here's what they do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save Without Events</strong> saves the chart without saving it's events.</li>
<li><strong>Save Events Separately</strong> saves the events in a separate file, which gets parsed on any difficulty chart you play on. <em>(Note that if you used this you have to also use <strong>Save Without Events</strong>, otherwise you will face issues with duplicate events)</em></li>
<li><strong>Save Meta</strong> saves the meta into a separate file.</li>
<li><strong>Export For FNF Legacy</strong> saves the chart in a format that is supported by other FNF engines.</li>
<li><strong>Save For Psych Engine</strong> saves the chart specifically in Psych Engine's format.</li>
</ul>
