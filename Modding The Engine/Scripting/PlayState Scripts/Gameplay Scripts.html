<h1>Gameplay Scripts</h1>
<h3>Gameplay scripts run during gameplay <em>(yep)</em></h3>
<p>You can run Gameplay Scripts in <strong>a song</strong>, by putting the scripts in <code>./song/YOUR SONG/scripts</code>, or run them in <strong>every song</strong>, by putting them in the <code>./songs</code> folder itself.</p>
<p>Gameplay Scripts can change the gameplay in various ways, for example, this is how you can hide the player character:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hx">function create() {
    boyfriend.visible = false;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or how to create a normal sprite:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hx">function create() {
    var sprite = new FlxSprite(x, y).loadGraphic(Paths.image(&quot;my new sprite&quot;)); //picks the png image from the ./images folder
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you notice, this looks slightly like source code, aside from the usual <code>override function</code> or <code>super.create()</code>, which does not exist in our scripting language.&lt;br&gt;
If you already got the hang of source coding, then scripting will feel like a breeze. If not.. well.. prepare to learn!</p>
<h3>Particularities</h3>
<h4>Script events.</h4>
<p>Noting other particularities, Gameplay Scripting relies heavily on <strong>Events</strong>, which triggers callbacks and returns a struct of parameters, basically unclogging the parameter list of functions.&lt;br&gt;
Which means, handling a note hit looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hx">function onNoteHit(event) {
    trace(event.note); // the note that has been hit
    trace(event.score); // how much score gained from this
    event.cancel(); // cancels out any other handling (useful if you want to write custom note pressing)
}
</code></pre>
<p>There's a lot of other events, such as <code>onStartCountdown</code>, <code>onGamePause</code>, <code>onCameraMove</code> and more.&lt;br&gt;
You can find them all in &lt;a href=&quot;../All of the script calls.md&quot;&gt;All of the script calls&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<p>Despite all of that, functions like <code>update</code>, <code>beatHit</code>, <code>stepHit</code> still receive one parameter *(<code>elapsed:Float</code>, <code>curBeat:Int</code>, <code>curStep:Int</code>)</p>
<h4>Class importing.</h4>
<p>Some classes are pre-imported (FlxSprite, FlxMath, FlxAxis etc.), but for classes that aren't pre-imported, it's still possible to import like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hx">import flixel.addons.display.FlxBackdrop;
</code></pre>
<p>*(<code>using</code> does not work) *</p>
<h4>Accessing characters.</h4>
<p>Characters are actually accessed differently. Due to the modularity of having more than one Strumline, and having more than one character in a Strumline, characters are accessible like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hx">trace(strumLines.members[0].characters[0]); // opponent character
trace(strumLines.members[1].characters[0]); // player character
trace(strumLines.members[2].characters[0]); // girlfriend character
</code></pre>
<p>Though we have also established a few shortcuts to avoid typing this much code</p>
<pre><code class="language-hx">trace(dad);
trace(boyfriend);
trace(gf);
</code></pre>
<h4>Replacing <code>mustHitSection</code>.</h4>
<p>Sections do not exists, and therefore, <code>mustHitSection</code> no longer works. But, as a workaround, you can use <code>curCameraTarget</code> to replace it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hx">if (curCameraTarget == 1) // mustHitSection == true
</code></pre>
